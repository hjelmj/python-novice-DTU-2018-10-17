# python-novice-DTU-2018-10-17

This page is rendered as an html page [here](https://hjelmj.github.io/python-novice-DTU-2018-10-17/).

A repository with teaching materials for a Python workshop at DTU Energy 2018-10-17. This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example.
 
This lesson is mostly based on material from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lesson [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).


## To do *before* the workshop
[Pre-workshop survey](link to survey): plese fill this in at least two days in advance of the workshop!


## Workshop Pre-requisites

1. Learners need to understand what files and directories are, and what a [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) is.

2. Learners must install Python and Jupyter Notebook before the class starts - we strongly recommend that you use the platform independent [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) provided for free by Anaconda, Inc. This distribution comes with a large number of scientific packages pre-installed, including Jupyter Notebook.

    * download the Python 3.7 version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows)

    * If you already have Anaconda installed, please make sure you have Python version 3.5 or newer installed (if you are running Python 2.7 we can send you instructions for setting up an extra Python 3 environment alongside your Python 2.7 installation using Anaconda - contact Johan or Doris).

3. Learners must get the gapminder data before class starts: please download and unzip the file [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://files.dtu.dk/u/4iVV-a8lVf_wJVX4/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip?l)


## Set-up instructions 

Detailed setup instructions (for the installation of Anaconda) can be found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/).


## Agenda for the workshop
We recommend that you open a blank notebook and type along with the instructor. 
This is also a good way to keep a record of what you've done, your solutions to the exercises, and any problems you have encountered.
