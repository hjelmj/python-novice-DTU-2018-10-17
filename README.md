# python-novice-DTU-2018-10-17

This page is rendered as an html page [here](https://hjelmj.github.io/python-novice-DTU-2018-10-17/).

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example.
 
This lesson is mostly based on material from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lesson [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).


## To do *before* the workshop
[Pre-workshop survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh6y849ImfnA3RLCHRmPiLBFM1-ju4DtZfG7TPKc2g2dXmIA/viewform): please fill this in at least two days in advance of the workshop!


## Workshop Pre-requisites

1. Learners need to understand what files and directories are, and what a [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) is.

2. Learners must install Python and Jupyter Notebook before the class starts - we strongly recommend that you use the platform independent [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) provided for free by Anaconda, Inc. This distribution comes with a large number of scientific packages pre-installed, including Jupyter Notebook.

    * download the Python 3.7 version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows)

    * If you already have Anaconda installed, please make sure you have Python version 3.5 or newer installed (if you are running Python 2.7 we can send you instructions for setting up an extra Python 3 environment alongside your Python 2.7 installation using Anaconda - contact Johan or Doris).

3. Learners must get the gapminder data before class starts: please download and unzip the file [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://files.dtu.dk/u/4iVV-a8lVf_wJVX4/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip?l)


## Set-up instructions 

Detailed setup instructions (for the installation of Anaconda) can be found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/).


## Agenda for the workshop
We recommend that you open a blank notebook and type along with the instructor. 
This is also a good way to keep a record of what you've done, your solutions to the exercises, and any problems you have encountered.

## Workshop repository

All the notebooks used by the instructors can be found [here](https://github.com/hjelmj/python-novice-DTU-2018-10-17).

## What else is out there?

The Python based scientific eco-system is growing fast and there are many useful generic and domain specific packages that are available. There is a quite comprehensive list of tutorials, packages, books etc on the [Topical Software](https://www.scipy.org/topical-software.html) page from the SciPy documentation pages.

### Matlab to Python/NumPy

For those with experience from MATLAB there are some useful resources to aid in the process of getting proficient with Numpy/Scipy, see for example the page ["NumPy for Matlab users"](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) and the table from Mathesaurus [here](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html).

### Tutorials & Galleries

Some of the most useful sets of tutorials for getting started include:

* [Software Carpentry]() - Lessons to help getting started with Python, Version Control, Unix Shell, etc
* [Python SciPy Lecture Notes](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/) - a tutorial and an excellent reference
* [Lectures on Scientific Computing](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) by J.R. Johansson - another excellent set of tutorials. In particular [Lecture 4 on Matplotlib](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/tree/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb) is very good and is strongly recommended.
* This is not a tutorial but a useful figure to study to understand [the anatomy of a matplotlib figure]()

There are interesting and useful galleries with examples of notebooks for many different purposes (*e.g.* you can find the LIGO gravitational wave detection analysis as a notebook [here]()), see for example:

* [A Gallery of Interesting Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks) - an great collection of notebooks curated by the Jupyter team.
* [Matplotlib's Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) - full of examples of different plot types and provides the source code for all of them (try to copy the link to the source code, and then type `%load <insert copied link here>` in a cell in a Jupyter notebook and see what happens...(then execute this cell).
* [The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) -  a large collection of examples also covering other popular visualization packages.


### Cheat Sheets

The following are examples of cheat sheets that can be helpful. The ones linked to below are provided by DataCamp and are geared towards Data Science.
