    "### Coding Style\n",
    "Coding style helps us to understand the code better. It helps to maintain and change the code. Python relies strongly on coding style, as we may notice by the indentation we apply to lines to define different blocks of code. Python proposes a standard style through one of its first Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP), PEP8, and highlight the importance of readability in the Zen of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may highlight some points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document your code\n",
    "* Use clear, meaningful variable names\n",
    "* Use white-space, not tabs, to indent lines"

    "* PEP8: a style guide for Python that discusses topics such as how you should name variables, how you should use indentation in your code, how you should structure your import statements, etc. Adhering to PEP8 makes it easier for other Python developers to read and understand your code, and to understand what their contributions should look like. The PEP8 application and Python library can check your code for compliance with PEP8.\n",

    "* Assertions are a simple, but powerful method for making sure that the context in which your code is executing is as you expect.\n",
    "* If the assertion is `False`, the Python interpreter raises an `AssertionError` runtime exception. The source code for the expression that failed will be displayed as part of the error message. To ignore assertions in your code run the interpreter with the ‘-O’ (optimize) switch. Assertions should contain only simple checks and never change the state of the program. For example, an assertion should never contain an assignment.\n"
